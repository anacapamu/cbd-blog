I recently discovered that Home Depot offers free in-store kids' workshops on the first Saturday of every month. There’s no age limit, and despite what the website says, you don’t need to RSVP online *(9/7/24 update: The lady at Home Depot told us that the sign ups online determine how many kits the store gets, so if you can sign up online, please do so).* Just show up between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. on the first Saturday of the month, and you’ll find a tent set up in the parking lot. After filling out a form, you’ll receive the project kit for the month. You can choose to take the kit home or complete it at the designated tables next to the tent. Home Depot provides all the necessary tools for the project, such as paintbrushes and hammers at the tables. The website does mention "while supplies last," but I've arrived close to noon before and still managed to get a kit. However, availability may vary depending on your location.

Each kit comes with the materials needed for the project (though not the tools like paint or a hammer), a commemorative pin, instructions, and a sheet with ideas on how to extend the activity. If you'd like an apron, you can ask for one, but the lady at our local Home Depot mentioned they haven’t received apron shipments in months.

Every month features a different theme, and this month’s project is all about soccer. I’ve included a vocabulary list of soccer terms that you can share with your child as you build the project together. Since this activity is essentially a mini foosball game, I’ve added that term to the vocab list as well. Happy building!
