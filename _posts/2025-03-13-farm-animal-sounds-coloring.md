![black and white coloring page of farm animals and the sounds they make](/assets/img/[TN]TPFarmAnimalSounds.png)

When we started teaching our kid how to talk, we began with animal sounds. We got her a few sound books, and her favorite was the one with farm animals. I always knew that animal sounds were different in Chinese as my parents used to tell me that dogs say “wang wang,” not “woof woof” like I learned in school. But I didn’t realize just how different some of the other sounds were, like “heng heng” for a pig instead of “oink.” I have included a table comparing Chinese and English farm animal sounds, and below that, you will find free download links for a coloring page I made featuring the animals and their sounds in both languages.
