My daughter has been obsessed with transportation books like *Things That Go* ever since our trip to Canada. During our travels, we were hopping on trains to and from airports, catching buses to sightseeing spots, embarking on boats to islands, and boarding planes to different countries. It was a whirlwind of movement and discovery! To keep reading to her in Mandarin, I have put together a translated vocabulary table for *Things That Go* below. All aboard for some choo-choo reading fun!
