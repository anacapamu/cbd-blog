![book cover of Little Crab's Adventure](https://i.imgur.com/yPl6cb2.jpg)

I have been reading cloth books to my kiddo, who loves playing with the flaps. With her attention span being less than 5 minutes, these short books (usually one sentence per page and around five pages long) are perfect. Since the books we appreciatively got from other moms are in English and I want her to be exposed to as much Chinese as possible, I need to translate the pages for her. To lighten my mental load, I’ve created these little vocab cheat sheets that I will be sharing here under the [vocab list category](/categories/vocab-list/).

The first vocab list post will be on *Little Crab's Adventure*. A quick Google search shows that there are several versions of this book, each featuring slightly different art and colors, but the content appears to be the same. Enjoy joining little crab on their adventure, where you’ll meet a big-mouthed whale and dance with an octopus. Happy reading!
