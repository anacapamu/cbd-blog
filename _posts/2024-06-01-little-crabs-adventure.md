I have been reading cloth books to my kiddo, who loves playing with the flaps. With her attention span being less than 5 minutes, these short books (usually one sentence per page and around five pages long) are perfect. Since the books we appreciatively got from other moms are in English and I want her to be exposed to as much Chinese as possible, I need to translate the pages for her. To lighten my mental load, I’ve created these little vocab cheat sheets, which I’ll be sharing here under the category "Bookcabulary."

The first "Bookcabulary" post is on *Little Crab's Adventure*. I have included the translated vocabulary from the book in the table below. Enjoy joining little crab on their adventure, where you’ll meet a big-mouthed whale and dance with an octopus. Happy reading!
