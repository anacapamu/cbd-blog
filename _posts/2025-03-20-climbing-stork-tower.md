登鸛雀樓 (dēng guàn què lóu), or Climbing the Stork Tower, is a poem by 王之渙 (Wang Zhihuan) and is #236 in the 300 Tang Poems collection [1]. The poem brought fame to the Stork Tower (Guanque Tower), an ancient structure in Puzhou Town, Yongji, Shanxi, originally built during the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420–589) by Yuwen Hu (513–572); it was named after the storks that frequently perched on it [2].
