A few months ago, my daughter started daycare, and it took her about a month to adjust. To help ease her feelings about going to school, her teachers introduced this song to her. It’s her least favorite, so she rarely sings along. Interestingly, the song isn’t widely known; I never heard it growing up, and even the YouTube videos I found have very few views. Below, you'll find the lyrics with pinyin, simplified Chinese characters, and an English translation.

## Lyrics

| English | Pinyin  | Simplified |
|-----|---|---|---|
| Going to Preschool | shàng yòu ér yuán | 上幼儿园 |
| Dad and Mom go to work | bà ba mā ma qù shàng bān | 爸爸妈妈去上班 |
| And I go to preschool. | wǒ shàng yòu ér yuán | 我上幼儿园 |
| I don’t cry or fuss | wǒ bù kū yě bù nào | 我不哭也不闹 |
| And greet the teacher with "Good morning!" | jiào shēng lǎo shī zǎo! | 叫声老师早！|
