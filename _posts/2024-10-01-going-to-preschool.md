A few months ago, my daughter started daycare, and it took about a month for her to adjust. They taught her this song, though it’s her least favorite, so she never actually sings it. The song doesn’t seem to be widely known; I hadn’t heard it growing up, and even the YouTube videos I found don’t have many views. Below, I’ve included the lyrics with pinyin, traditional and simplified Chinese characters, and an English translation.

It’s worth noting that 幼儿园 often translates to ["kindergarten"][1], but here I’ll use ["preschool"][2] to be more inclusive.

## Lyrics

| English | Pinyin  | Traditional  |  Simplified |
|-----|---|---|---|
| Going to Preschool | shàng yòu ér yuán | 上幼兒園 | 上幼儿园 |
| Dad and Mom go to work | bà ba mā ma qù shàng bān | 爸爸媽媽去上班 | 爸爸妈妈去上班 |
| And I go to preschool. | wǒ shàng yòu ér yuán | 我上幼兒園 | 我上幼儿园 |
| I don’t cry or fuss | wǒ bù kū yě bù nào | 我不哭也不鬧 | 我不哭也不闹 |
| And greet the teacher with "Good morning!" | jiào shēng lǎo shī zǎo! | 叫聲老師早！| 叫声老师早！|


Note that those who use traditional Chinese would normally use 幼稚園 (yòu zhì yuán) instead of 幼兒園 for "preschool".
