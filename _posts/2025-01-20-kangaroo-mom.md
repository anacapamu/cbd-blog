I am amazed by how many Chinese children’s songs are out there about a kangaroo mom’s pouch (see [1] and [2])! I even found a YouTube video with the exact same song as the lyrics below [3], but—just my luck—it got taken down before I could finish this post. A quick Google search led me to some Douyin (Chinese TikTok) videos featuring the same song. However, I could not really figure out how to share the videos (what looks like a share button led to a QR code) and the videos kept autoplaying like a neverending playlist... 

## Lyrics

| English | Pinyin  | Simplified |
|-----|---|---|---|
| Kangaroo Mom |  | 袋鼠妈妈 |
| Kangaroo mom has a pouch |  | 袋鼠妈妈有个袋袋 |
| Inside the pouch is a baby |  | 袋袋里面装个乖乖 |
| The baby and mom love each other |  | 乖乖和妈妈相亲相爱 |
| Love each other |  | 相亲相爱 |
